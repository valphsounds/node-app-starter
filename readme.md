# NodeApp Starter

A preset for a node app with mongodb. Also included is some snippets for vscode I use.
To add snippets in vscode:
1. Open command pallete (Ctrl + Shift + P / Shift + Cmd + P)
2. Write 'snippets' and choose 'Snippets: Configure User Snippets.'
3. Choose html.json and then do the same for javascript.json.
4. Open vscode-snippets.txt and copypaste the appropriate content into each file.
5. Save and enjoy.
